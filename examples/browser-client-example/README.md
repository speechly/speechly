# Speechly Browser Client Example

Example web app showcasing the usage of Speechly Browser Client. Built with [Speechly Browser Client](https://github.com/speechly/speechly/tree/main/libraries/browser-client), JavaScript and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

## Getting started

You'll need a [Speechly account](https://api.speechly.com/dashboard/) and a Speechly application that's using a Conformer model. Follow our [quick start guide](https://docs.speechly.com/basics/getting-started) to get started with Speechly.

## Installation

Open in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/speechly/speechly/tree/main/examples/browser-client-example?file=/README.md), or copy the example app using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit).

```bash
npx degit speechly/speechly/examples/browser-client-example my-app
cd my-app
```

Add the **App ID** of your Speechly application into `app.js`.

```ts
const client = new BrowserClient({
  appId: 'YOUR-APP-ID', // Get your App ID from: https://api.speechly.com/dashboard/
  logSegments: true,
  debug: true,
  vad: { enabled: isVadEnabled },
});
```

Install dependencies and start development server.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Enabling NLU features

By default, NLU features are disabled and Speechly operates in speech-to-text mode. To enable them, youâ€™ll need to provide a configuration for your application. The example application will list the intent and entities for each speech segment below the transcript.
