// The Speechly client source that is published to npm is located in the
// "dist" directory. This utility script is called when building Speechly client,
// to make sure the "dist" directory is prepared for publishing.
//
// This script will:
//
// - Delete unnecessary type definition files, which are rolled up by api-extractor.
// - Copy the current root package.json into "dist" after adjusting it for
//   publishing.
// - Copy the supporting files from the root into "dist" (e.g. `README.MD`,
//   `LICENSE`, etc.).

// from happening in the root of the project. This sets the package back to
// public so it can be published from the "dist" directory.

// to point to the files within the same directory.
