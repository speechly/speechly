- 2021/03: Svelte can't use nested components from customElements. Nested components need to be also customComponents, and thus create their own shadow doms and styles. Seems unnecessarily heavy e.g. with every child node having own <style>, but not sure. Parent's style won't affect the child. Using flat hierarchly in big-transcript for now. As workaround, build script can be tweaked to compile customElements based on file name, but styling issues remained.
- 2021/03: Transitions on WebComponents not working https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/4735 > Using transFix.js to wrap transitions

## 1.0

- push-to-talk-button, big-transcript components

## 0.5

- Handles connection to @speechly/browser-client, send update-segment CustomEvent

## 0.4

- Deprecated `onholdstart` and `onholdend` attributes in favour of CustomEvents of similar names.
- Tried using `<template>` for icon art, but removed it due to it making things difficult for Wix
- Moved "custom" customElement method definitions like render() to constructor because Safari/iOS 12.5 did not work properly when they were defined as class methods
- Used autonomous variant of customElement for Safari support. This way, our supported browser platforms should not change (not verified, though)
