# Speechly Browser UI components

Ready made Speechly [UI components](https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/ui-components/) to build a reactive voice interface to a web site or app. [CodePen example](https://codepen.io/speechly/pen/vYJoePR)

> If you want to build a custom interface for you web app, you may want to check out [browser-client](https://github.com/speechly/speechly/tree/main/libraries/browser-client) library for direct access to Speechly API. [See more options.](#learn-more)

## Documentation

- [UI components overview and API](https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/ui-components/) in [docs.speechly.com](https://docs.speechly.com).
- [Basic Usage](https://docs.speechly.com/client-libraries/usage/) in [docs.speechly.com](https://docs.speechly.com).

## Browser Usage

Include the Web Components from a CDN that mirrors `@speechly/browser-ui` npm package. The script tags register `push-to-talk-button`, `big-transcript` and `error-panel` with the browser's customElement registry so you can use them like regular tags.

```
<head>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/@speechly/browser-ui/core/push-to-talk-button.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/@speechly/browser-ui/core/big-transcript.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/@speechly/browser-ui/core/error-panel.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
   <big-transcript placement="top"></big-transcript>
   <push-to-talk-button placement="bottom" appid="YOUR_APP_ID_FROM_SPEECHLY_DASHBOARD"></push-to-talk-button>
   <error-panel placement="bottom"></error-panel>
</body>
```

> Push-to-talk button component comes with built-in [browser-client](https://github.com/speechly/speechly/tree/main/libraries/browser-client) so you don't need to include it separately.

## Node Usage

> This example illustrates using browser-ui Web Components with a JS framework. For actual React development, you'll probably want to use [react-client](../react-client) and [react-ui](../react-ui) libraries for a better developer experience.

```
npm i @speechly/browser-ui
```

In App.js:
```
import "@speechly/browser-ui/core/push-to-talk-button";
import "@speechly/browser-ui/core/big-transcript";
import "@speechly/browser-ui/core/error-panel";

...

<big-transcript placement="top"></big-transcript>
<push-to-talk-button placement="bottom" appid="YOUR_APP_ID_FROM_SPEECHLY_DASHBOARD"></push-to-talk-button>
<error-panel placement="bottom"></error-panel>
```

## Building the components from source

These steps are only needed if you need to contibute to the development of the components or need to fork them for customization.

### Requirements

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/) (tested with v14.16.1)

### Built With

* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Svelte 3](https://svelte.dev/)
* [Speechly browser-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@speechly/browser-client) that provides websocket connectivity and audio handling for Push-To-Talk Button component

### Build steps

```
pnpm install
pnpm build
# Check build artefacts
ls core/
```

> This library is part of a Rush monorepository. See [libraries/README.md](https://github.com/speechly/speechly/tree/main/libraries) for steps to run browser-ui changes against a test application.
