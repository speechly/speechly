# Speechly Demos

Speechly Demos is a Rush monorepository that contains multiple single-page web applications showcasing voice application control with [Speechly](https://speechly.com). The demos are written in React/TypeScript using Speechly's React client libraries, UI components and Voice form components.

## Contents of the repository

### [Speech-to-text demo](https://www.speechly.com/technology/voice-api/speech-to-text/)

Demonstrates Speechly's raw speech-to-text capabilities. See below for [steps](#requirements) to build the demo yourself. You can also try the app deployed from this repository embedded on [Speechly's web site](https://www.speechly.com/technology/voice-api/speech-to-text/). Scroll down to find the push-to-talk button!

### [Flight booking demo](https://speechly-demos.herokuapp.com/flight-booking)

Demonstrates how to fill a booking form with text fields, dropdowns and checkboxes using both voice (VUI) and touch/type (GUI). The voice interface has been configured to extract keywords (entities) like *departure* and *return date* and *number of passengers* for the Voice form components to display. You can [try the deployed web app](https://speechly-demos.herokuapp.com/flight-booking) and say something like:

- _"Show me direct flights from New York to Miami for 2 passengers departing tomorrow."_

### [Checkout demo](https://speechly-demos.herokuapp.com/ecommerce-checkout)

Another demonstration of multimodal VUI/GUI form filling. You can provide the recipient, shipping and payment details. The voice interface has been configured to extract keywords (entities) like *name* and *phone number*, *email*, *shipping address* and other relevant information from the speech. You can [try the deployed web app](https://speechly-demos.herokuapp.com/ecommerce-checkout) and say something like:

- _"Name Jane Smith, email jane@acme.com"_

## Requirements

Check if you have the tools already installed

```bash
git --version
node --version
npm --version
rush -h
```

If necessary, install the build tools

- Install [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- Install node and npm from <https://nodejs.org/>
- Install rush globally with npm: `npm install -g @microsoft/rush`
- Install pnpm globally with npm: `npm install -g pnpm`

Clone this repository, if you haven't already:

```bash
# download the repository into `speechly` folder
git clone git@github.com:speechly/speechly.git
```
## Run and develop an application with Rush

```bash
cd speechly-demos

# Update dependencies
rush update

# Build dependencies
rush build

# Run an app
cd flight-booking-demo
rushx start
```

## Creating a new Speechly app

```bash
npx create-react-app applications/new-demo-app --template file:cra-template-speechly
cd applications/new-demo-app
rushx start
```

Remember to replace `YOUR_APP_ID_FROM_SPEECHLY_DASHBOARD` in `src/App.tsx` with your own app id from [Speechly Dashboard](https://api.speechly.com/dashboard).

To build the new app along with other projects, add the following lines to "projects" array in `rush.json`:

```
{
  "packageName": "new-demo-app",
  "projectFolder": "applications/new-demo-app"
},
```

Then follow the steps to [Run and develop an existing application with Rush](#run-and-develop-an-application-with-rush)

## Developing a library against a sample app

In terminal 1, run this command to build library dependencies for `flight-booking-demo` and stay in watch mode to rebuild any changes to dependencies:

```
# Build dependency and stay in watch mode
rush build:watch --to-except flight-booking-demo
```

In terminal 2, run the app using the development server in watch mode
```
cd applications/flight-booking-demo
rushx start
```

## Basic rush skills

### Update/add a project dependency

```
rush add --package @speechly/react-ui@latest
```

#### Check for mis-matching dependencies across projects

```
rush check
```

## Using Voice form components

Add `@speechly/react-voice-forms` dependency to the project:

```
rush add --package @speechly/react-voice-forms
```

Include the components:

```
import {
  VoiceDatePicker,
  VoiceCheckbox,
  VoiceInput,
  VoiceSelect,
  VoiceToggle,
} from '@speechly/react-voice-forms';
```

Place the form components inside your `SpeechProvider` block:

```
<SpeechProvider appId="YOUR_APP_ID_FROM_SPEECHLY_DASHBOARD">
  <VoiceInput label="From" changeOnIntent="book" changeOnEntityType="from" />
</SpeechProvider>
```

### Styling Voice form components

Add a `voice-form-theme-mui.css` to your `src` folder, then include it in `index.tsx`:

```
import "voice-form-theme-mui.css";
```
