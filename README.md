Speechly monorepository contains Speechly's web related [libraries](#libraries), [demos](#demos) and [example apps](#examples).

## Libraries

Speechly client libraries provide the natural Spoken Language Understanding API for web applications. They handle audio capturing and streaming, authentication, and network connection to Speechly cloud API.

Speechly UI libraries provide UI components to support building a voice-enabled, multimodal apps.

## How to use this Rush monorepository

This monorepository is set up using [rushjs](https://rushjs.io). Rush can be used to build all projects and libraries in one go. It also helps with develop and test features that span multiple libraries and/or projects.

Each project and library is a stand-alone node project that can be built and devoped with npm or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). To run a single examples or demos, just follow the instructions in the project's README.

### To build all projects using Rush, run

```
npm install -g @microsoft/rush
npm install -g pnpm
rush update
rush build
```

This will build everything in the repository – This may take a while! After this step, you can run any example or demo by navigating to the corresponding folder (e.g. `examples/browser-client-example`) and running

```
rushx start
```

Before doing a PR, remember to create a changelog entry with

```
rush change -b origin/main
```
