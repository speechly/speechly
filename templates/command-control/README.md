# Command and control template

This template shows how to use Speechly for command-and-control. Useful for things like navigation and finding information on a site.

It's built on the standard [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) template and comes with the following additional packages:

- [Speechly React client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@speechly/react-client)
- [Speechly React UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@speechly/react-ui)

_Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed._

## Get started

Create and deploy your application in the [Speechly Dashboard](https://api.speechly.com/dashboard/)

Copy the template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) and install the dependencies

```bash
npx degit speechly/speechly/templates/command-control my-app
cd my-app
npm install
```

Add your `App ID` to `src/index.js`, you can get it from the [Speechly Dashboard](https://api.speechly.com/dashboard/)

```js
// index.js
<SpeechProvider appId="YOUR_APP_ID_FROM_SPEECHLY_DASHBOARD">
```

Start the development server

```bash
npm start
```

Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see your app running. Open the Developer Console to see speech segement outputs.

## Next steps

Once you have the application up and running, take it a step further by introducing more sections to the site.
